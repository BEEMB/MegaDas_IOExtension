In this folder you will find some exemples to know how to use the extension module library 

--*-- The DigitalRead exemple:
      This exemple shows how to read digital input value from the extension input pins
      The code is so simple! just using one API which is DigitalRead
      like the Arduino digitalRead API 
      
--*-- The DigitalWrite exemple:
      This exemple shows how to write digital output value over the extension output pins
      The code is so simple! just using one API which is DigitalWrite
      like the Arduino digitalWrite API
